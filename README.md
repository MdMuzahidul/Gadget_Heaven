## React Fundamental Concepts Used

1. **Components**: The project is structured using functional components to build reusable UI elements.
2. **Props**: Props are used to pass data between components.
3. **State**: The `useState` hook is used to manage local state within components.
4. **Effect**: The `useEffect` hook is used for side effects such as data fetching and updating the DOM.
5. **Context API**: The Context API is used for state management to share data across the component tree without prop drilling.
6. **React Router**: React Router is used for client-side routing to navigate between different pages of the application.

## Data Handling and Management

- **Context API**: The Context API is used to manage global state, such as the cart and wishlist, across the application.
- **Local Storage**: Local storage is used to persist user data, such as the cart and wishlist, so that it remains available even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

1. **Product Listing**: Browse a wide range of gadgets, including smartphones, laptops, and accessories.
2. **Product Details**: View detailed information about each product, including specifications, price, and ratings.
3. **Add to Cart**: Add products to the cart and view the total cost.
4. **Wishlist**: Add products to the wishlist for future reference.
5. **Search Functionality**: Search for products by name or category to quickly find what you're looking for.
6. **User Profile**: Access user-related actions such as viewing the profile, settings, and logging out through a user profile dropdown in the navbar.
7. **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
